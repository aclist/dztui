## What this is
DZGUI allows you to connect to both official and modded/community DayZ servers on Linux and provides a graphical interface for doing so. This overcomes certain limitations in the Linux client and helps prepare the game to launch by doing the following:

1. Search for and display server metadata in a table (server name, player count, ping, current gametime, distance, IP)
2. Add/delete/manage favorite servers by IP or ID
3. Find and prepare mods being requested by the server (choose from manual or automatic installation)
4. Concatenate launch options to pass to Steam

Other options include the ability to connect by IP or ID or  set a favorite server.

## Setup and usage

Refer to the [manual](https://aclist.codeberg.page) for installation and setup instructions, a feature-by-feature breakdown, and Steam integration tutorials.
