## What this is
DZGUI allows you to connect to both official and modded/community DayZ servers on Linux and provides a graphical interface for doing so.

This overcomes certain limitations in the Linux client and helps prepare the game to launch by providing features like:

- Search for and display server metadata in a table (server name, player count, ping, queue size, current gametime, distance, IP)
- Add/delete/manage favorite servers by IP or ID
- Quick-connect to favorite/recent servers
- Find and prepare mods being requested by servers (choose from manual or automatic installation)
- Bulk delete/update local mods
- Concatenate launch options to pass to Steam
- Connect to mod-enabled LAN servers

## Setup and usage
