# Preamble
This project is free and open source software (FOSS) that is improved upon through the collaborative efforts of its community.

To foster a collegial and productive atmosphere, all interactions with this project and its members shall be subject to these standards.

"Members" refers to all project maintainers, contributors, developers, and end-users.
Bear in mind that members may come from different countries, age groups, and backgrounds, and have differing experience levels.

# Standards
- Do not engage in antagonistic, offensive, discriminatory, threatening, or inflammatory behavior or trolling towards other members under any circumstances.
- Engage in professional communication and stay on topic. Keep banter and jokes to a minimum, as they are liable to be misconstrued.
- Do not post offensive or inflammatory off-site content, or content violating the above standards or the terms of service of this site.
- Do not post spam. The site operator implements anti-spam measures that may lead to your account being revoked.
- While this project relates to the DayZ computer game, it is not a forum for non-technical discussion about the game, or a place to post unsolicited links.
- Do not use images, emoji reactions, or other non-verbal gags as justification for skirting the above standards.

# Off-site content
From time to time, it may be necessary to include off-site reference material or links. Use discretion when selecting this content and provide
the minimum necessary for a technical discussion of the matter. Do not willfully include content that violates the above standards.

# Enforcement
Violations of the above standards will be subject to moderation decisions.

Project maintainers reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned with these standards, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Depending on the nature of the violation, or if the violation is not corrected after a warning has been issued, the user may be permanently barred from further interaction with the project.

# Technical support
This project is free software, but this does not imply a guarantee of free, unlimited tech support and troubleshooting in perpetuity.
The software is provided as-is, and no warranty is made as to its fitness for a given purpose or that it is free from defects.

Project members volunteer their time. Do not disparage other members when they attempt to assist you.
Be aware that if you cannot provide enough information when filing a ticket, this may lead to the ticket being closed as non-actionable.
